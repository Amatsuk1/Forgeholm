## Definition
**Forgeholm** is a secluded island located off the coast of Faerun, surrounded by treacherous waters and hidden in mist.
This island has become a haven for technological innovation. The ruling technocratic council, known as the Gearmasters, has established a "steampunk" utopia, free from the influence of traditional magic.
