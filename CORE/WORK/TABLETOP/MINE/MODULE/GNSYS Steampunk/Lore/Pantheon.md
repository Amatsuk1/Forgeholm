## Gods of Faerun
### Mystra, the Goddess of Magic
Mystra is the deity associated with the Weave, the source of all magic in the Forgotten Realms. The imprisonment and exploitation of mages for Aetherium Essence might be viewed as a severe violation of the natural order of magic. Mystra may be displeased, leading to consequences such as magical disruptions, curses, or divine intervention aimed at rectifying the imbalance.

### Tyr, the God of Law and Justice
Tyr is a deity known for upholding justice and law. The systematic oppression of mages in Forgeholm could be seen as an injustice. Tyr might inspire champions or send omens urging the rulers of Forgeholm to reconsider their treatment of mages, potentially leading to a moral and ethical awakening.

### Lathander, the Morninglord
Lathander is associated with renewal, creativity, and dawn. The use of Aetherium Essence through the imprisonment of mages may be viewed as a stifling of creativity and a violation of the natural cycle. Lathander might inspire artists, bards, and champions of freedom to bring about change in Forgeholm.

### Kelemvor, the Lord of the Dead
Kelemvor presides over the passage of souls to the afterlife. The mistreatment of mages and the potential harm caused to their souls may draw Kelemvor's attention. The god of the dead might send emissaries or visions to convey a warning or offer guidance on rectifying the spiritual imbalance.

### Torm, the True
Torm is a deity known for duty, loyalty, and righteousness. The imprisonment and exploitation of mages in Forgeholm might be seen as a violation of these principles. Torm may inspire paladins and champions to intervene, ensuring that justice and righteousness prevail.

### Mask, the Lord of Shadows
Mask is the god of shadows, intrigue, and thieves. The clandestine nature of Forgeholm's operations and the potential for suffering among the imprisoned mages may draw Mask's attention. The deity might favor schemes or covert actions to expose and rectify the situation.

### Bane, the Tyrant
Bane is a deity associated with fear, hatred, and tyranny. Depending on Bane's disposition, he might either endorse Forgeholm's actions or see an opportunity to sow chaos and discord. The mistreatment of mages could become a focal point in the struggle for power and control.

### Deneir, the Lord of All Glyphs and Images
Deneir is associated with writing, art, and literature. The suppression of magical creativity in Forgeholm might be viewed as an affront to the creative spirit. Deneir may inspire scribes, bards, and artists to create works that shed light on the plight of the mages.
