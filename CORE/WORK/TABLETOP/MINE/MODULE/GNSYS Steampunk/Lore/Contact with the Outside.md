## Reasons not to conquer the Forgeholm
### Geographical Isolation
Forgeholm's island location, surrounded by treacherous waters and hidden in mist, makes it a challenging target for invasion. The difficulty of navigating the waters and the risks associated with such a maritime assault may dissuade military commanders.
### Unknown Defenses
The mysterious nature of Forgeholm's technological defenses could be a significant deterrent. Faerun's military may lack detailed intelligence on the capabilities of the island's automated defenses, magical wards, and other protective measures.
### Aetherium Essence Dependency
Faerun may depend on Forgeholm for a steady supply of Aetherium Essence, making the island a critical economic partner. A direct attack could jeopardize this resource flow, leading to potential economic and magical repercussions.
### International Backlash
An unprovoked attack on Forgeholm could lead to diplomatic isolation and backlash from other nations that rely on Aetherium Essence trade. Faerun might risk damaging relationships with important allies and trading partners.
### Magical Resistance
The presence of potent magical defenses on Forgeholm could deter Faerun's military, especially if the island's technology includes powerful anti-magic measures. Attempts to breach these defenses might result in significant losses.
### Economic Consequences
Faerun's economy could be deeply entwined with Forgeholm's technological innovations. Any disruption to the island's operations, whether through invasion or aggressive actions, might lead to economic downturns, affecting industries and citizens.
### Technological Disparity
The level of technological advancement in Forgeholm could create a significant disparity in military capabilities. Faerun's leaders might be hesitant to engage in a conflict where the outcome is uncertain due to unfamiliar technology.
### Resistance Movement
The existence of the Mistwalkers, the resistance movement within Forgeholm, might deter Faerun from attempting an invasion. The potential for guerrilla warfare, sabotage, and alliances with external forces could make occupying Forgeholm a difficult proposition.
### Resource Allocation
Faerun's military might prioritize other geopolitical concerns or threats. The logistical challenges and potential resource drain of an invasion on Forgeholm may not align with the current strategic goals.
### Diplomatic Solutions
Diplomacy might be the preferred approach for Faerun to gain access to Forgeholm's technologies. Negotiating trade agreements, alliances, or technological exchanges could be more favorable than risking the uncertainties of war.
